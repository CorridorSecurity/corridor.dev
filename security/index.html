      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Corridor Security Inc. welcomes feedback from security researchers and the
          general public to help improve our security. If you believe you have
          discovered a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other security
          issues in any of our assets, we want to hear from you. This policy outlines
          steps for reporting vulnerabilities to us, what we expect, what you can expect
          from us.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Systems in Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or maintained by
          Corridor Security Inc.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assets or other equipment not owned by parties participating in this policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems should be
          reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable authority.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Our Commitments</h2>
        <p>When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and
            validate your report;
          </li>
          <li>
            Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is
            processed;
          </li>
          <li>
            Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within our
            operational constraints; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this
            policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Our Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, we ask
          that you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant
            agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other
            applicable terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
          </li>
          <li>Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly;</li>
          <li>
            Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying
            data, and/or harming user experience;
          </li>
          <li>
            Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide us a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from the initial
            report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly;
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities
            which are out-of-scope;
          </li>
          <li>
            If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of
            data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a
            Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you
            encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable
            Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data,
            or proprietary information;
          </li>
          <li>
            You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit
            permission from the account holder; and
          </li>
          <li>Do not engage in extortion.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="term-section">
        <h2>Official Channels</h2>
        <p>
          Please report security issues via <a href="mailto:contact@corridor.dev">contact@corridor.dev</a>, providing all
          relevant information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for
          us to triage and fix the issue.

        <h2>Safe Harbor</h2>
        <p>
          When conducting vulnerability research, according to this policy, we consider
          this research conducted under this policy to be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not
            initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good-faith
            violations of this policy;
          </li>
          <li>
            Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not
            bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
          </li>
          <li>
            Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or Acceptable
            Usage Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting security research,
            and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in
            good faith.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal
          action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with
          this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were
          conducted in compliance with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security
          research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of
          our Official Channels before going any further.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Note that the Safe Harbor applies only to legal claims under the control of

            bind independent third parties.
