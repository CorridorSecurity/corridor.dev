      <p><strong>Effective Date: March 31, 2025</strong></p>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Corridor Security Inc. is an AI-powered Secure by Design platform.</p>
      <p>
        We understand that you are aware of and care about your own personal
        privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Notice
        describes the Corridor's policies and practices regarding its collection
        and use of your personal data, and sets forth your privacy rights. We
        recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so
        we will from time to time update this Privacy Notice as we undertake new
        personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-protection-officer">Data Protection Officer</h2>
      <p>
        Corridor is headquartered in Delaware, in the United States. Corridor
        has appointed an internal data protection officer for you to contact if
        you have any questions or concerns about Corridor's personal data
        policies or practices. If you would like to exercise your privacy
        rights, please direct your query to Corridor's data protection officer.
        Corridor's data protection officer's name and contact information are as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack Cable<br />

      </p>

      <h2 id="how-we-collect">
        How we collect and use (process) your personal information
      </h2>
      <p>
        Corridor collects personal information about its website visitors and
        customers. With a few exceptions, this information is generally limited
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>email address</li>
        <li>Content (such as code repositories) uploaded by users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use this information to provide prospects and customers with
        services. We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share
        it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our services.
      </p>

      <h2 id="use-of-website">Use of the Corridor Website</h2>
      <p>
        As is true of most other websites, Corridor's website collects certain
        information automatically and stores it in log files. The information
        may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, the region or general
        location where your computer or device is accessing the internet,
        browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use
        of Corridor's website, including a history of the pages you view. We use
        this information to help us design our site to better suit our users'
        needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with
        our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor
        movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in
        identifying visitor preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corridor has a legitimate interest in understanding how members,
        customers and potential customers use its website. This assists Corridor
        with providing more relevant products and services, with communicating
        value to our sponsors and corporate members, and with providing
        appropriate staffing to meet member and customer needs.
      </p>

      <h2 id="sharing-information">
        When and how we share information with third parties
      </h2>
      <p>
        The personal information Corridor collects from you is stored in one or
        more databases hosted by third parties located in the United States.
        These third parties do not use or have access to your personal
        information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval. On
        occasion, Corridor engages third parties to send information to you,
        including information about our products, services, and events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of our third party sub processors can be found here: Amazon Web
        Services, Microsoft, Anthropic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not otherwise reveal your personal data to non-Corridor persons or
        businesses for their independent use unless: (1) you request or
        authorize it; (2) it's in connection with Corridor-hosted and Corridor
        co-sponsored conferences as described above; (3) the information is
        provided to comply with the law (for example, compelled by law
        enforcement to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or court order),
        enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights,
        property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees
        or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or
        service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) to address
        emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to
        persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf. We may also
        gather aggregated data about our services and website visitors and
        disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally
        identifiable) information to our partners, service providers,
        advertisers, and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Corridor website connects with third party services such as GitHub.
        If you choose to share information from the Corridor website through
        these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If
        you are a member of a third party service, the aforementioned
        connections may allow that service to connect your visit to our site to
        your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="transferring-data">Transferring personal data to the U.S.</h2>
      <p>
        Corridor has its headquarters in the United States. Information we
        collect about you will be processed in the United States. By using
        Corridor's services, you acknowledge that your personal information will
        be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor
        received a finding of "adequacy" from the European Union under Article
        45 of the GDPR. Pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR, Corridor is
        providing for appropriate safeguards by entering binding, standard data
        protection clauses, enforceable by data subjects in the EEA and the UK.
        These clauses have been enhanced based on the guidance of the European
        Data Protection Board and will be updated when the new draft model
        clauses are approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the circumstance, Corridor also collects and transfers to
        the U.S. personal data with consent; to perform a contract with you; or
        to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Corridor in a manner that
        does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Corridor endeavors to apply
        suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal
        data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Corridor
        and the practices described in this Privacy Statement. Corridor also
        enters into data processing agreements and model clauses with its
        vendors whenever feasible and appropriate. Since it was founded,
        Corridor has received zero government requests for information.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-subject-rights">Data Subject rights</h2>
      <p>
        The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other
        countries' privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects. Data
        Subject rights under GDPR include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right to be informed</li>
        <li>Right of access</li>
        <li>Right to rectification</li>
        <li>Right to erasure</li>
        <li>Right to restrict processing</li>
        <li>Right of data portability</li>
        <li>Right to object</li>
        <li>Rights related to automated decision making including profiling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This Privacy Notice is intended to provide you with information about
        what personal data Corridor collects about you and how it is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to confirm that Corridor is processing your personal data,
        or to have access to the personal data Corridor may have about you,
        please contact us.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also request information about: the purpose of the processing;
        the categories of personal data concerned; who else outside Corridor
        might have received the data from Corridor; what the source of the
        information was (if you didn't provide it directly to Corridor); and how
        long it will be stored. You have a right to correct (rectify) the record
        of your personal data maintained by Corridor if it is inaccurate. You
        may request that Corridor erase that data or cease processing it,
        subject to certain exceptions. You may also request that Corridor cease
        using your data for direct marketing purposes. In many countries, you
        have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection
        authority if you have concerns about how Corridor processes your
        personal data. When technically feasible, Corridor willâ€”at your
        requestâ€”provide your personal data to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost. If
        access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, Corridor will
        provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for
        some reason access is denied, Corridor will provide an explanation as to
        why access has been denied.
      </p>
      <p>
        For questions or complaints concerning the processing of your personal
        data, you can email us at contact@corridor.dev. Alternatively, if you
        are located in the European Union, you can also have recourse to the
        European Data Protection Supervisor or with your nation's data
        protection authority.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-storage">Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your personal data is stored by the Corridor on its servers, and on the
        servers of the cloud-based database management services the Corridor
        engages, located in the United States. The Corridor retains service data
        for the duration of the customer's business relationship with the
        Corridor and for a period of time thereafter, to analyze the data for
        Corridor's own operations, and for historical and archiving purposes
        associated with Corridor's services. Corridor retains prospect data
        until such time as it no longer has business value and is purged from
        Corridor systems. All personal data that Corridor controls may be
        deleted upon verified request from Data Subjects or their authorized
        agents. For more information on where and how long your personal data is
        stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and
        portability, please contact us at: contact@corridor.dev.
